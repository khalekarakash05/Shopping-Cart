Shopping Cart Project

This is a frontend-only shopping cart application built using React and Redux. 
The application fetches product data from a fake API and allows users to add items 
to their cart, view the cart summary, and proceed to checkout.


Features:
- Home Page: Displays a list of products with details.
- Add to Cart: Allows users to add products to the shopping cart.
- Cart Summary: Displays the selected products, total price, and total items.
- Checkout: Provides a "Checkout Now" button to simulate a purchase.
